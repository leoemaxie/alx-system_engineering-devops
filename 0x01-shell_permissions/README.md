# Shell Permission

## Overview
A series of tasks involving the change of file permissions & ownerships and their options. Some of the commands learnt are:
* `chmod` to change mode (file permissions)
* `chown` to change owner
* `chgrp` to change group
* `whoami` to display the current user
* `group` to display the groups on a system
As usual files prefixed with units and tens e.g `2-groups` represent the beginner tasks. Prefixed in the hundreds are the advanced tasks e.g `102-if_only`.
