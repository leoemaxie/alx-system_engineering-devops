# Alx System Engineering Devops

## Overview
A series of tasks and exercises aimed at understanding the commandline.

## Structure
* Shell Basics: Tasks aimed at having a solid overview of the commandline and essential commands such as `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`. This is housed in the [0x00_shell-basics](/0x00-shell_basics) directory.

* Shell Permissions: Covers tasks aimed at changing file permissions using `chmod`, file ownerships using `chown`, group ownerships using `chgrp` and their options as well as using various commands to determine the users and groups on the system. This is housed in [0x01-shell_permissions](/0x01-shell_permissions) directory. 

* Shell Redirections & Filters: Contains tasks aimed at understanding shell redirections between the standard I/O, files and commands. This is housed in [0x02-shell_redirections](/0x02-shell_redirections) directory.

* Shell, Init files, Variables and Expansions: Contains tasks aimed at understanding the shell environment, configurations and essential files. This is housed in [0x03-shell_variables_expansions](/0x03-shell_variables_expansions) directory.

* Loops, Conditions and Parsing: Introduction to loops and conditionals in bash. This is housed in [0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing](/0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing) directory.

* Processes and Signals: Processes and signals in bash. This is housed in [0x05-processes_and_signals](/0x05-processes_and_signals) directory.

* Regular Expression: Regular expression and pattern matching in ruby. This is housed in [0x06-regular_expressions](/0x06-regular_expressions) directory.

* Networking Basics #0: Networking Part 1. A theoretical introduction to Networking. This is housed in [0x07-networking_basics](/0x07-networking_basics) directory.

* Networking Basics #1: Networking Part 2. An hands-on practical introduction to Networking using commandline tools and programs in Linux. This is housed in [0x08-networking_basics_2](/0x08-networking_basics_2) directory.

* Configuration Management: Configuring servers, files and processes on Linux. This is housed in [0x0A-configuration_management](/0x0A-configuration_management) directory.

* SSH: Authentication and remote login into remote servers and computers using Secure Shell (SSH). This is housed in [0x0B-ssh](/0x0B-ssh) directory.
