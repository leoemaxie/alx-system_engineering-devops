# Shell, Init files, Variables and Expansions

## Overview
A series of tasks aimed at understanding the shell environment, configurations, variables and initialization. Some of the commands covered are: 
* `printenv` to print environmental variables
* `printf` to format and display data
* `alias` to create alias to commands

Environmental variables such as `USER` `OLDPWD` and `HOME` were also covered. Command and arithmetic substitution such as `$(())`, `[[]]` were also used in the tasks.

As usual, files prefixed with units and tens e.g `2-path` represents the beginner tasks. Prefixed in the hundreds are the advanced tasks e.g `102-odd`.
