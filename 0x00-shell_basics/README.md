# Shell basics

## Overview
A series of tasks aimed at having a solid overview of essential shell commands and their options. Some of the commands include: 
* `pwd` to print working directory 
* `cd` to change directory
* `ls` to list
* `mkdir` to make (create) directory
* `rm` to remove files

As usual, files prefixed with units and tens e.g `14-copy_html` represent the beginner tasks. Prefixed in the hundreds are the advanced tasks e.g `101-clean_emacs`.
