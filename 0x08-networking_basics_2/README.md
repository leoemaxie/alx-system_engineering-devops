# Networking Basics #1

## Overview
 Networking Part 2. An hands-on practical introduction to Networking using commandline tools and programs in Linux.

 Some of the tools used include:
 * netstat
 * tcpdump
 * ifconfig
 * nc

As usual, files prefixed with units and tens e.g `0-simply_match_school` are manadatory tasks. Prefixed in the hundreds are the advanced tasks e.g `100-textme`.
